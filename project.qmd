**Summary**

Traffic accidents pose a significant challenge for cities, affecting safety, traffic flow, and public well-being. To better understand the dynamics of traffic accidents in İzmir, we utilized the data set titled **“İzmir Metropolitan Municipality Defective, Accident Vehicle Data”**, published on the İzmir Metropolitan Municipality Open Data Portal. This data set provides valuable information such as the date, type, time, and destination of traffic accidents that occurred within the metropolitan area.

The primary aim of this project is to analyze and interpret the data to uncover patterns, identify critical problem areas, and offer insights that can contribute to improved traffic management and accident prevention strategies. By leveraging this data set, we aim to address several key questions:

**Accident Prone Destinations:** Which directions experience the highest number of accidents, and what factors may contribute to these trends?

**Date-Based Accident Patterns:** Which date ranges see the highest frequency of accidents? Are there specific days or months with consistently high rates?

**Time-Based Trends:** What time ranges during the day are most accident-prone? How do these patterns correlate with daily traffic flows and rush hours?

**Response Time Trends:** How efficient are interventions in terms of response time? Are there significant variations across different times or locations?

**Monthly Accident Trends:** What patterns can be observed in the number of accidents on a monthly basis? Are there any seasonal trends?

**Impact of Special Days and Seasons:** How do events such as holidays or seasonal changes influence the frequency and nature of accidents?

By analyzing these questions, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of traffic accidents in İzmir. The findings from this project can offer actionable insights to policymakers, traffic authorities, and urban planners, helping them implement targeted measures to enhance road safety, reduce accidents, and improve traffic efficiency in the city.

This project demonstrates how open data can serve as a powerful tool for addressing real-world challenges, fostering evidence-based decision-making, and promoting a safer city for all residents.
